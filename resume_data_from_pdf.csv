issue which affects 1ACOS directly.
I monitored the Defense Travel System (DTS) daily and identify orders and authorizations needing approval and provided notification to the

In my position as the Staff Accountant for HQ USAFE I was responsible for providing accounting and financial oversight and advice to
customers throughout the Command in support of the USAFE Comptroller.
I was responsible for performing ongoing analysis of financial programs to identify negative trends and weaknesses, ensured specific
weaknesses were corrected, and determined whether systemic or repeat issues were identified and adequately addressed.
I was required to apply a comprehensive knowledge of analysis/reporting requirements and data produced to resolve these issues.
In collaboration with DFAS Europe, developed an automated tool that identifies duplicate obligations by comparing records in the
accounting system to the contracting system and provided notification to the funds manager for review and resolution.
This tool eliminated hours of manual research and results allowed HQ USAFE to deobligate over $5M in duplicate obligations.
I was responsible for establishing various performance metrics which ensured effective and efficient use of USAFE financial resources.
I supported the USAFE/FMA Financial metrics program by collaborating with DFAS Limestone in the development of an automated tool
that provided senior leaders with visibility to any USAFE unit that is not in compliance with the established rules and regulations related to
the GPC.
This tool provides management reports that are used to populate the monthly metric charts which are briefed by the USAFE/FMA.
This tool provided the capability for USAFE/FMA to collaborate with USAFE Contracting and develop/deploy joint guidance that supports
the established Air Force Instruction mandating card suspension for card holders who are not in compliance with required reservation of
funds in the entitlement system in support of the GPC.
I identified and resolved a problem with five GPC accounts that had been rejecting during the automated interface process each month.
My research revealed that these accounts were rejecting for invalid paying station and required manual intervention by both Wing and
DFAS personnel.
This not only created rework, it delayed the payment of the invoices.
I partnered with DFAS Denver, corrected the records in the Access On-Line accounts eliminating the error condition.
I identified a method to deliver one-on-one training in support of the USAFE deployment of the Open Document Analysis (ODA) tool in
FMSuite.
By utilizing Defense Connect Online I 
provided training remotely, virtually eliminating the need to expend funds on Temporary Duty (TDY)
travel.
The results of this training produced results that went well above expectations and were noted by the ODA Program Management Office.

accomplished.
I also ensured fund balances were reconciled and reports were verified prior to release to base activities and higher headquarters.
Limestone reorganized under the High Performing Organization (HPO) in January 2007 and at that time I was reassigned to AM&C, a
Directorate which previously did not exist.
My challenge during that time was to staff my branch, implement an aggressive training schedule, and ensure the continuity of financial
reporting was maintained.
As we transitioned into the HPO we continued defining the missions and functions for AM&C for the entire network.
I participated in biweekly conference calls with Standards and Compliance in an effort to define missions and functions for AM&C.
Worked with management in determining FTEs needed for the branch.
I was responsible for developing meaningful performance standards for my employees since this branch and its functions did not previously
exist.

As Chief Of Accounts Payable 
I was responsible for the overall management of a branch consisting of over 120 employees.
My four first line supervisors were responsible for establishing priorities, schedules, and work assignments ensuring changes in workload are
accounted for to minimize the impact on normal office operations.
We consistently reviewed these areas and made necessary personnel moves based on shifting priorities.
This was 
extremely important during the DFAS Denver directed database consolidations and with the assumption of the Air National Guard
workload.
Workload increased rapidly while staffing increased gradually, which dictated frequent priority changes and personnel moves.
I also worked closely with the Major Commands supported by DFAS Limestone strengthening our partnership when workload spikes
negatively impacted our customers.
In December 2004, our overaged invoice percentage was nearing 25% and we had a backlog of vendor pay documents exceeding 30,000.
By working with the DFAS Command Client Executives and the Major Command Comptrollers, I was instrumental in forming a strategy
that included soliciting Air Force personnel assistance in document processing, identification of ""must pay now"" bills, and the formation of
special action response teams dedicated to responding to our customer's most urgent requirements.
As a result of these efforts, in a three month period, we were able to reduce our overaged invoice percentage by 19% and our backlog of
documents to no documents over 20 days old thereby minimizing the adverse impact on customer funds.
I was responsible for providing personnel feedback sessions quarterly and prepared supervisory appraisals of employees' performance and
potential for advancement.
Partnering with the management staff and employees, I was instrumental in establishing Employee Performance Plans that linked employee
performance to established DFAS Strategies and Balance Scorecard goals.
In this position as a supervisory accountant I was responsible for performing ongoing analysis of the Vendor Pay workflow and production
to identify negative trends and weaknesses, ensure specific weaknesses have been corrected, and determine whether systemic or repeat
issues have been identified and adequately addressed.
I was required to apply a comprehensive knowledge of analysis/reporting requirements, work processes, vendor pay system structures, and
data produced to resolve these issues.
Utilizing my expertise with Louis II data retrieval software, I produced ad-hoc data queries for in-house and external use by our customers.
These retrievals were designed to reduce the man- hours necessary to perform complex finance and accounting functions by DFAS and Air
Force personnel.
I was responsible for the budget resources necessary to operate the branch.
In this capacity, I prepared budget over execution justifications, plan and monitor overtime costs, and control supply purchases to ensure the
most cost efficient operation possible.
I was required to respond to inquiries from various sources, which include, but are not limited to, vendors, DFAS management, accounting
liaison offices, resource advisors, and other DFAS field sites.
These inquiries required my ability to relay technical aspects of systems deficiencies to customers who are not familiar with our operation.
I participated in video teleconferences, conference calls, and briefings designed to address customer and DFAS management requirements.
I was called upon to explain, in laymen's terms, DFAS policy and procedures with regards to delays in payment due to various reasons.
I responded to various audit reports and studies; ensuring senior management and audit personnel, understand particular situations within the
Vendor Pay business process that result in these findings.

Recruited by the Board of Directors to become COO.
Oversaw all aspects of this 35+ year old medical practice comprised of 5 freestanding radiation oncology clinics located in the South Puget
Sound with 8 physicians (6 whom are owners) and 64 employees.
Revenues grew from $48MM in 2008 to over $53MM in 2014.
This was due to the addition of two offices (one in Gig Harbor and one in Olympia) as well as additional modalities of treatment.
Achievements: Saved the company over $160,000 in 2015 due to hard negotiations with our Electronic Medical Record vendor due to
poor performance.
Saved the company over $120,000 annually by negotiating with the bank to lower interest rates on loans in early 2009.
Brought two construction projects, one for a new clinic with a $6.5MM budget and the other for an extensive remodel with a $4.5MM
budget, under budget and on time saving $200,000 in total.
Brought in a consultant to successfully turn the Board Meetings into efficient, professional meetings with strict agendas, time allotments for
each topic and rules of order.
Prior to that, the meetings were overly lengthy, ineffective and combative.
This resulted in fewer meetings, which have been far more effective.
Oversaw the opening of and addition of a Urology practice as well as the first mobile Brachytherapy unit in the State of WA (for the
treatment of various types of cancer).
Both contributed to an increase in revenues to the company of more than $1MM annually.
Successfully negotiated with two of the owners for buyouts on behalf of the Board.
One was amicable and the other was contentious.
This will result in cost savings to the company in excess of $1MM annually.

COLB was started in 1993 and has grown to an $8.5 billion dollar, 150+ branch community bank in WA, ORE and ID.
Recruited by and joined as Vice President and Commercial Banker with no loan portfolio 
05/1998 Through aggressive sales
calls/marketing, grew portfolio to over $30MM in outstandings and $50MM in commitments in three years! 
This was accomplished with a
consistent and active marketing plan aimed at targeting well known businesses in the area as well as utilizing a strong referral base consisting
of lawyers, accountants and existing customers of the Bank.
Promoted to SVP due to growth of portfolio and fee income/referrals 
06/2001 Promoted to SVP and SWWA Commercial Banking
Manager 
06/2003 In this position, I was responsible for 8 commercial middle market lenders, whose territory stretched from Auburn to
Longview, WA.
While Columbia had started via a bank in Longview, it had been neglected from a commercial lending standpoint.
I spent considerable time and effort in working with the lending center there to establish a robust and larger presence.
Achievements: Overall TEAM portfolio grew from outstandings of $100MM to over $160MM in a highly competitive, charged
environment.
At one time this was the largest commercial market in the Bank (CB later entered Seattle, King County).
Implemented monthly sales meetings to emphasize consistent marketing and calling efforts, both with prospects and in cross-selling to
existing customers.
This resulted in deposit growth within the group from $100MM to over $200MM and fee income exceeding $1,200,000 annually.
Also during this time I was active in mentoring individual lenders, assisting with credit structure and pricing and calling on both prospects and
existing clients.
I worked hard to foster strong lines of communication and collaboration with other departments in the Bank who were our partners in
business development and instrumental in our success.
Was asked to join Loan Committee as a voting member.
June 2005
As my credit knowledge and responsibilities had grown, I was asked and approved to sit on the Bank's loan committee.
This was an opportune time to view all of the various types of credits that were presented.In addition, during this time I was part of an assigned team to perform due diligence on potential bank purchases.

2012 for $2B, I was brought in to develop and lead the finance team and work with the executive team through the acquisitions of Con Ed
Solution's (2007) and by RCN Communications (2008).
Major Achievements:.
Balancing the push and pull between sales efforts and maintaining margins was the focus of the Request for Proposal (RfP) tracking and
analysis tool I developed to manage the contract review and approval process.
Integrating two processes performed using MS Excel and monitored individually, I created and linked a sales pricing database with a cost
identification database to foster improved sales decisions by bringing finance, sales and technical operations together in a formalized review.
Telecommunications expenses represent 40% of total operating expenses at Sidera.
Ensuring the accurate tracking and timely payment of these customer impacting costs are crucial.
I created a circuit inventory tracking database to facilitate accurate cost analysis and reporting which resulted in a zero network outage rate
over the subsequent two year period with $100K of estimated annual savings in penalties and fees.

A $1B comprehensive provider of wireless communications and software solutions to the healthcare, government, large enterprise and
emergency response sectors, Originally hired as an Assistant Controller, I experienced substantial professional growth achieving three
promotions culminating in overseeing the global finance team including accounting, financial reporting and analysis while working closely with
the Executive management team.
Major Achievements:.Working with the Engineering and Technical Operations teams I created lease and licensing database solutions in order to maintain FCC
regulatory compliance saving the company $1.2M in penalties and fines.
Through acquisition the company was operating 13 individual billing systems and the ability of senior management to make timely business
decisions was hampered by a slow consolidation's process.
With the focus on closing the books and producing standard reporting, meaningful analysis was an after-thought.
In order to provide the leadership team with better tools I established a database solution mapping each individual billing system to my data
warehouse with an export into Lawson that allowed for a timely and accurate close in less than five days.
