ranging from paper/plastics, to all meats and veggies, also drinks and alcohol. this task also means i must handle all ordering trough the different distributors and vendors we may use. my job requires me on a daily basis to: cook and marinate rice, cut and prepare fish for the day, making sushi-rolls, nigiri, sashimi, platters etc. im also required to assist customers sitting at the sushi bar with any inquiries or concerns they may have. over the course of the 6 years i have been employed by towa, i have gained so much. ive matured so much through this job and sushi really has become such a passion of mine. i am a really hard worker who is also fun to work with, who is merely seeking a new opportunity to further my skill set and continue doing what i love. i have a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. and i have no problem adjusting to any style or training. i will work any days/nights or weekends and holidays if necessary. educational background associate of applied science : electrical-computer engineering 2012 savannah technical college , city , state , united states ged : general education wayne county highschool , city , state , united states wayne county high school grades 9-11 glynn adult literacy program-ged skills",CHEF,10,3
